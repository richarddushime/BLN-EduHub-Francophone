 # Our Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Taking accountability and offering apologies to those who have been impacted by our errors,
  while also gaining insights and learning from the situation
* Focusing on what is best, not just for us as individuals, but for the
  community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community 
in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, 
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
